# Getting Started with Terraform

I've been using CloudFormation for several years now. I've fully embraced Infrastructure as Code (IAC) and script almost every resource I use in AWS. I personally write my CloudFormation scripts in YAML but CloudFormation does have its shortcomings. My biggest issue with it is that it is not modular.
