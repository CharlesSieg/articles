# Development Tools for macOS

I do a lot of development work in macOS. [I write iOS apps](http://www.renkara.com). I create web services that run on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). I create databases in [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com). I write shell scripts and [Python](https://www.python.org) scripts. Sometimes I write [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps or full-stack [React](https://reactjs.org) web apps. I create [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) scripts. I use the whole range of AWS products and services including [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora), [ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift), [Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), [Elasticsearch](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/), you name it. I thought it would be a good idea to itemize the resources I use in my work and publish it here in case it is useful to someone.
